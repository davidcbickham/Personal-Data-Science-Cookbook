# Personal-Data-Science-Cookbook

Collection of code, personal projects, and resources across machine learning, clustering, forecasting, statistical modeling, and model interpretability methods.. It's a work in progress, I'll continue to add to it over time. All are welcome you use the code for your own projects. I hope it's helpful!
